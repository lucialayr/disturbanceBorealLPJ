    <p>This repository contains code and data needed to reproduce the data analysis and figures of the paper *Disentangeling future effects of climate change and forest disturbance on vegetation composition and land-surface properties of the boreal forest* by Layritz et al., currently submitted to Global Change Biology</p>

Per default, this repository will contain only the `final` data used to generate the figures. All other processing steps can be downloaded from Zenodo. The  scripts that generated the subsets from the raw data can also be found on Zenodo. They were run on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure and I can't guarantee that they'll run on another machine.

[!CAUTION] The data will be available once the paper is published.

## Reproducing analysis

The repository is wrapped in a Docker container to ensure all libraries are installed in the correct version.

1. Docker image was generated using `sudo docker build --build-arg WHEN=2023-10-09 -t disturbance_boreal_lpj .` It is not recommended to regenerate unless something was changed in the code. Especially if new packages were installed, this would be necessary. Beware that this will install all packages from scratch, so this will take a while. If new packages need to be installed, this should be done via the Dockerfile found in this folder.

2. Run the Docker container. `sudo docker run disturbance_boreal_lpj`. If everything works fine, this will return you to the terminal

3. Execute code: To redraw the figures run `RScript code/run_plots.R`. To recreate final data run `RScript code/create_final_data.R` To recreate processed data run `RScript code/create_processed_data.R`. 

The data analysis is per default parallelized on four cores. 

## Folder structure

The folder structure is as follows:

│&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└──  `util_*.R`&#x1F4C4; *various helper functions*

│&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└──  `*_subset_processed.R`&#x1F4C4; *creates processed data from subset*

│&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└──  `*_processed_final.R`&#x1F4C4; *creates final data from processed*

│&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└──  `*_plot.R`&#x1F4C4; *create figures from final data*

├── **data** &#x1F4C1;  *model output on various steps of processing*

│&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└── raw &#x1F4C1; *Raw model output. Not contained in the repository but can be downloaded from Zenodo.*
  
│&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└── subset &#x1F4C1;  *Subsets of the raw data generated before downloading to local. Can be downloaded from Zenodo(approx 2G of data)*
  
│&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└── processed &#x1F4C1; *generated by `*_subset_processed.R` from the subset data. Can be downloaded from Zenodo (approx 5 GB of data).*
  
│&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└── final &#x1F4C1;  *The data directly underlying the figures, generated with  `*_processed_final.R`*

│&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;│&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└── shp &#x1F4C1; *The shapefiles used for plotting maps.*

│&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└── ext &#x1F4C1;  *External helper files*
  
├── **plots** &#x1F4C1; *Contains all the plots of the paper. The plots are generated by the scripts `*_plot.R`.*

## to-do

- [ ] customize to enable sequential processing
- [ ] control should tell user if input data for executed processing step is missing.
